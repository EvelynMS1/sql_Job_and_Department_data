## Description

The incentive behind this application was for the skill of navigating and obtaining information from a database. In this case searching through a company’s database that displays information based on the users’ inquiries. This application solves interacting with the database friendlier to use with a content management system with the help of Inquirer, Node.js and MySQL. I learned how database tables shared information between each other and how to obtain specific information with the use of SQL queries.
